"igh" and "igl" designations are hardcoded into BASIC.py thus need to conform TCR filenames to this format

Human TCR-
    alpha chain- "igh"
    beta chain-  "igl" 

Mouse TCR (maca)-
    alpha (and gamma) chain- "igl"
    beta (and delta) chain-  "igh" 

    Using beta as the heavy as BASIC attempts to assemble the heavy first, which will result in a productive chain for pre- T cells that have a beta chain paired with a pre-alpha
